# core-strengths

**Hi Scrum Facilitators!**

The cheat sheet you find here is intended to help teams and individuals explore and discuss core strengths. For now only in dutch as the english version is already available through [Ben Linders](https://www.benlinders.com/) (the original creator of this content). The sheet can be used with his [Exploring strengths with Core Qualities Retrospective plan](https://www.benlinders.com/2015/exploring-strengths-with-core-qualities/), or as you like. Please let us know potential other uses, we'd be glad to list alternative Retrospective or valuable usage ideas!

## Releases

Use the **Release** to get the most stable and updated version of the core strengths cheat sheet. Weâ€™ll promise to keep it updated ;-)
